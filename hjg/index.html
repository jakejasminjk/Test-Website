				<h1>Welcome!</h1>

				<p>I am the heat of your hearth on the cold winter nights, the friendly shade screening you from the summer sun, and my fruits are refreshing draughts quenching your thirst as you journey on.
				I am the beam that holds your house, the board of your table, the bed on which you lie, and the timber that builds your boat.
				I am the handle of your hoe, the door of your homestead, the wood of your cradle, and the shell of your coffin.
				I am the bread of kindness and the flower of beauty. 'Ye who pass by, listen to my prayer: Harm me not.
				(This prayer has been used in the Portuguese forest preservations for more than 1,000 years.) 
				Though much is taken, much abides....
				One equal temper of heroic hearts,
				Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
				To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.--
				Alfred Lord Tennyson -- Ulysses 
				Look at the trees, look at the birds, look at the clouds, look at the stars... and if you have eyes you will be able to see that the whole existence is joyful. Everything is simply happy. Trees are happy for no reason; they are not going to become prime ministers or presidents and they are not going to become rich and they will never have any bank balance. Look at the flowers - for no reason. It is simply unbelievable how happy flowers are.-
				Osho .</p>
